[**Metalnx**](https://metalnx.github.io/) is a Web application designed to work alongside the [iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System)](https://irods.org/). It provides a graphical UI that can help simplify most administration, collection management, and metadata management tasks removing the need to memorize the long list of iCommands.

The application allows administrators to monitor system health, manage users, storage resources, and content.  It allows users to manage content and metadata associated with content.

For **rodsadmin** users:

- **Dashboard:** Displays information on the system health.
- **User Management:** Add, edit and remove users from iRODS. 
- **Group Management:** Create, edit and remove iRODS groups.
- **User Profile Management:** Create user profiles that contain pre-defined groups and permission settings that can be applied to any iRODS users as needed.  
- **Resource Management:** Add, remove, and view information about storage resources in the iRODS grid.   

For **rodsuser** users:

- **Collection Management:** Add, edit, upload, download, copy, move, and delete objects / collections as needed.
